Evolution is the process by which populations change over time, adapting to their environment(s). Before we discuss how evolution works, it is important to remember that evolution occurs at the population level, not at the individual animal level. Given enough time and a variety of evolutionary pressures, members of a species can become so different from their predecessors that they branch into new species. What is a species? For sexually reproducing organisms, a species is a group of individuals that can potentially mate and produce fertile offspring.
