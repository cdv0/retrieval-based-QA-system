The digestive system is made up of the digestive tract (the gut) and other organs like the liver, pancreas and gall bladder. It is where your body breaks down food and absorbs nutrients. The digestive system is a long, twisting tube that starts at the mouth and goes through the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine and ends at the anus. The digestive system breaks down food into simple nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats and proteins. These can then be absorbed into your blood, so your body can use them for energy, growth and repair. Anything that isn't used is waste, and leaves the body as faeces (poo).
